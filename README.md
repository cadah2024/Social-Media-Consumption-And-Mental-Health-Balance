# Overview
This project analyzes how social media usage affects mental health using a dataset of 500 individuals. It explores key variables such as daily screen time, sleep quality, stress levels, exercise frequency, and preferred social media platforms. The goal is to identify patterns and relationships that show how digital habits influence overall well-being. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization in Power BI, and insights that help explain the impact of social media on happiness, stress, and lifestyle balance.
# Project Objectives
-  Explore the relationship between social media usage and mental health indicators
  
-  Analyze the impact of daily screen time on sleep quality, stress levels, and overall happiness.

-  Evaluate whether spending more days without social media improves mental health indicators.

-  Compare different social media platforms to determine which ones are linked to higher stress or greater happiness.

-  Assess the role of exercise frequency in managing stress and improving sleep quality.

-  Determine the relationship between high stress, poor sleep, and low happiness to understand interconnected mental health patterns.
-  Provide data-driven insights and recommendations
