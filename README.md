# Overview
This project analyzes how social media usage affects mental health using a dataset of 500 individuals. It explores key variables such as daily screen time, sleep quality, stress levels, exercise frequency, and preferred social media platforms. The goal is to identify patterns and relationships that show how digital habits influence overall well-being. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization in Power BI, and insights that help explain the impact of social media on happiness, stress, and lifestyle balance.
# Project Objectives
-  Explore the relationship between social media usage and mental health indicators
  
-  Analyze the impact of daily screen time on sleep quality, stress levels, and overall happiness.

-  Evaluate whether spending more days without social media improves mental health indicators.

-  Compare different social media platforms to determine which ones are linked to higher stress or greater happiness.

-  Assess the role of exercise frequency in managing stress and improving sleep quality.

-  Determine the relationship between high stress, poor sleep, and low happiness to understand interconnected mental health patterns.
-  Provide data-driven insights and recommendations

# Key Metrics
### Social Media Usage
- TikTok and X (Twitter) have the highest number of users, showing they are the most active platforms among respondents, while Instagram and YouTube have relatively fewer users.

- Happiness levels are highest on LinkedIn and TikTok and slightly lower on Facebook and Instagram, suggesting professional or entertainment-focused platforms may contribute to better user satisfaction.

- Stress levels remain fairly consistent across platforms, but Facebook and Instagram users show slightly higher stress, possibly due to social comparison or content overload.

- Sleep quality is generally highest among LinkedIn users and lowest among TikTok and Instagram users, indicating that excessive entertainment-based scrolling might negatively affect rest.

### Screen Time Insights
- Male and female users spend nearly equal amounts of screen time, while the "Other" gender category records slightly lower usage.

- Instagram users have the highest average screen time, followed closely by Facebook and YouTube, indicating that visually driven and entertainment focused platforms drive more and prolonged usage.

- LinkedIn records the lowest screen time, suggesting that professional platforms encourage shorter and more purposeful interactions.

- Higher happiness scores are associated with lower screen time, showing a clear inverse relationship. Individuals who browse less tend to report greater happiness and life satisfaction.

### Behavior Metrics
-  65.8% of users fall under the “Good” sleep quality category, showing that the majority are not experiencing severe sleep problems.

- Only 12.4% of users report “Poor” sleep quality, indicating a smaller segment of the population struggles with rest.

- Happiness levels increase as exercise frequency increases, with those exercising 3–5 times per week showing the highest counts of happiness.

- Users who do not exercise or exercise only once per week show noticeably lower happiness levels, suggesting a positive link between physical activity and emotional well-being.
